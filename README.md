# SplicePredictor

SplicePredictor is a deep learning model for predicting splice sites in genomic sequences.

## Overview

SplicePredictor utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify DNA sequences as splice sites or non-splice sites. The model is designed to identify and predict the locations of intron-exon boundaries in pre-mRNA sequences.

## Features

- Convolutional neural network architecture
- Genomic sequence classification
- Splice site prediction
- TensorFlow-based implementation
