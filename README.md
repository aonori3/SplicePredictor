# SplicePredictor

SplicePredictor is a deep learning model for predicting splice sites in genomic sequences.

## Overview

SplicePredictor utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, specifically using GRU layers, to classify DNA sequences as splice sites or non-splice sites. The model is designed to identify and predict the locations of intron-exon boundaries in pre-mRNA sequences by learning from sequential patterns in the DNA data.
